# An into to Javascript Proxy Objects

## What are the two common operations that we will set in the handler?

get and set are the two common operations for a handler.

## What do you have to make sure you are doing with every Get to insure the value does not become undefined?

Calling console.log() and using the get operator will return a value.

## What are some of the benefits of the proxy object that we are using in our structure for applications?

We use the Proxyto to create a new object to override the get operator to prevent the use of the id property.
