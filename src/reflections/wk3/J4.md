# The Observer Pattern

## What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

It allows to build reuseable code that would be helpful to the clint-side scripting.

## What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms of the observer pattern are subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast.

## Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

The Observer pattern add more versitilty to the client/user side and seems to be a more fluid and reuseable coding pattern.
