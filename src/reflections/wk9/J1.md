# Capstone reflexction

## What technologies and principles are you using in your project?

We used MongoDB, Auth0 and RESTful api methods. As far as styling scss and bootstrap.

## What went well so far?

We did very good with planning before we started to code and deligated each section so that everyone felt comfortable with what task they were given.

## What would you do differently? Why?

Put a little more focus on paired programming and daily task management. Also starting with the Api towards the beginning.
