# C# Data Types

## What are the three categories of data types? How are they different?

Value type, Reference type, and Pointer type. 

## What are the Value-type data types? What differences do you notice from JavaScript?

The Value-type data types are: char, decimal, double, enum, int, float, bool, byte, sbyte, short, unit, unshort. They have different naming and some are shortened.


## In your own words how do Reference types get stored in memory? How does this differ from Value types?

The reference types find the location of where the data is stored. The Value types store the data and the reference types simply just refer to that data.
