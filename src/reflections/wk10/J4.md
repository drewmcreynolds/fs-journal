# C# Enum's

## What is an Enum, and what are some use cases for them?

Enums are like varibles that store specific values. 

## How can you modify an Enum?

Enums can not be modified after being built. The only thing that varies is what your input is.

## How have you used Enums in your afternoon lab projects this far?(if you have not yet, give an example of how you could)

I have not used an Enum in C# but I did you them in other checkpoints in the the past.
