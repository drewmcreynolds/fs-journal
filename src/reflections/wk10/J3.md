## In a SQL table, what is the difference between information in a row and information in a column?

In a SQL table the difference between the information in a row and column, is that a row contains all the information within an object and the column is data describing an attribute of many objects.

## Demonstrate the basic structure for creating a new table called characters with the values name, age, description as strings, and an int id.

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS characters(
  id int NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, name VARCHAR(255), age int, description VARCHAR(255)
)default charset uft8 COMMENT ' ';

## What is the difference between the following statements:

Delete from table_name is just removing an item from the table and drop table is removing the entire table, you will lose all your data.
