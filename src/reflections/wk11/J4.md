# Reflection

## Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your final project, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.

I've had a blast during this course. Learning to manage my expectations of myself has been a struggle but as get more comfortable with the my own pace of learninng new subjects I can relax and keep moving forward. I've planned to finish the server by the end of Monday and hopefully be done with the client by end of Thursday so I can have Friday to go for some strech goals. Taking breaks is very important to my success, it helps me stay focused and plan better. I truly enjoyed challenging myself with learning in such a condensed timeframe and I happy that this field is always changing and evolving so I can continue to learn.
