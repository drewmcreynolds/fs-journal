# Testing in Vue

## What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?

The three main typing of testing are end to end testing, unit testing and component testing. Unit testing is an individual unit of code. End to end is testing while using. Component testing is going thru most component of Vue to make sure they work correctly.

## What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?

I think E2E is the most useful because it validates all the layers of the app. It will be able to tell you if your app is functioning as intented.

## What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?

I would say component testing because you can combine unit testing and E2E and you wouldnt need to use component testing.
