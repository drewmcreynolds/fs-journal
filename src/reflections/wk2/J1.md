# Intro to Javascript

## Scope what it is!

Scope is  where the variable is accessable. Var is global, Let block and Const is block but cannot be re-declared.

## What is Hoisting ?

Hoisting is when a variable and function declaration is moved to the top of their scope before the code is executed.

## In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

let and const are going to be more reliable and var may cause bugs in your code. Let will be used most of the time.
