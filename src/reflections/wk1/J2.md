## What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

Specificity is giving a value to a selector which over rules the load order of the code. If you change a selector at the top of your style sheet to have a higher valued specificity it will use that over other lower valued selectors.

## What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

The !important feature is going to over ride any specificity that is in CSS and is bad practice.
