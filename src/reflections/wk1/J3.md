# Design Tactics

## What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

I couldn't pick one favotive tip, here a few I liked. Using fewer borders to make cleaner less jumbled look and also using acsent borders to add some color to a dull interface. I really liked the offset boxshadows to make them have a more realistic view. Also the aspect of having a more minimalistic approach to buttons by not giving all of them a background.

## Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

I really enjoy nature and I found this list of website with great nature based themes. https://www.vandelaydesign.com/25-nature-inspired-websites/


## How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

I think that good design would attarct more people to used a website and also have them remember what their favoite elements of the site. I feel an emotional respones could be conveyed depending a on the theme of the site. For example a nature based design theme could reduce stress and provide a soothing respones in the visiter.
